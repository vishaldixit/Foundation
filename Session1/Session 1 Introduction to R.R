#Introduction to R


#Purpose of these sessions is to get introduced with syntax and programming constructs
# of R, and to see how it can be used for data exploration and analysis

#High Level Programming language
# Widely used in academia and research
# Very good collection of packages and tools for statistical analysis and 
# machine learning tools
# Good functionality for textual analysis tools
#Can be used both in interactive mode and the development mode

#We will take a practitioner's based approach. Specifically, we will take data science case studies and try to
# solve them using R. In doing so, we will also look at all of the important syntax and programming constructs in R, 
# and how we leverage them in executing a typical data analytics project.

#R is an eco-system with basic programming constructs at the core. However, bulk of popularity for R comes not from 
# language itself but the vast number of tools and packages available for performing analyses. For example, in order 
# to use an exotic machine learning algorithm such as Random Forests, all that you need to do is call a function.

#R is a case sensitive language
ABC abc
#get current work directory
getwd()

#set a different working directory
setwd('D:/CBA/CBA/R') #For Windows
setwd('/Users/peeyushtaori/Desktop') #For Linux/OS X

#getting help
#The simplest way to get help in R is to click on the Help button on the toolbar 
#if you know the name of the function you want help with, you just type a question mark ? at the command line prompt followed by the
#name of the function.
help(solve)
?solve
?read.table

#Sometimes you cannot remember the precise name of the function, but you know the subject on which
#you want help (e.g. data input in this case). Use the help.search function (without a question mark) with
#your query in double quotes like this
help.search("data input")

#Other useful functions are find and apropos. The find function tells you what package something
#is in:
find("lowess")
#while apropos returns a character vector giving the names of all objects in the search list that match your
#(potentially partial) enquiry
apropos("lm")

#Packages are one of the most important eco-system of R. You would be using 
# packages continuously throughout the course and in your professional lives
#Installing a package: You can install a package by using install.packages command
install.packages("e1071")

#In order to view contents of the package, type:
library(help=e1071)

library(e1071)

#Language essentials

#Simple calculations: You can simply use R as a calculator
log(50)
5+3
#Multiple expressions can be placed in single line but have to be 
# separated by semi-colons
log(20); 3*35; 5+2

floor(5.3)
ceiling(5.3)
round(5.3)
round(5.9)

#Assignment operations
#Variable assignment is a very easy task in R. There are three important things 
# to keep in mind
# Variable names are case sensitive
# Variable names cannot begin with numbers
# Variable names cannot contain blank spaces
x <- 5
y = 5
print(x)
print(y)
#[1] indicates that x and y are vectors and 5 is the first element of the vector
x <- 1:50
x

#Sequences
0:20

20:6

seq(0,10,0.5)


#Difference between <- and = operator?

sum(z=1:50)
z

sum(ab <- 1:50)
ab


#Five basic data types: Character, Numeric, Integer, Complex, Logical
#Vector is most basic object. Can only contain objects of same class

a <- 7
a
str <- "abc"
str
boolean <- TRUE
boolean

ab<- TRUE

a+str
a+boolean
str+boolean

#Type conversion
x <- "abc"
class(x)
as.numeric(x)+a


#To identify the type of any object or structure, use class function
class(str)

# Many R operations can be performed, or performed more efficiently, on vectors or
# matrices. Vectors are strings of objects; matrices are two-dimensional collections of
# objects, usually numbers. The c operator, which means concatenate, creates simple
# vectors, while the colon (:) operator generates simple sequences. To construct matrices,
# one simply passes a vector of data, the dimensions of the matrix to be created, and
# whether to input the data by row or by column (the default behavior is to input data by row).                                                by row).

#c() is concatenate function

#Table: Perhaps the single most useful vector function in R is table. You need to see it in action to appreciate
#just how good it is. Here is a huge vector called counts containing 10 000 random integers from a negative
#binomial distribution (counts of fungal lesions on 10 000 individual leaves, for instance):

counts <- rnbinom(10000,mu=0.92,size=1.1)

#Factors - can be used to represent categorical data
#Factors are categorical variables that have a fixed number of levels. A simple example of a factor might be
#a variable called gender with two levels: 'female' and 'male'. If you had three females and two males, you
#could create the factor like this

#What is the difference between a categorical and continuous data?

#Tabular data is read into a type of data structure known as data frame.
#All variables in a data frame are stored as separate columns
#Different from matrix in the sense that each column can be of a different type
#Almost always, when you import data from an external data source, you import 
# it using a data frame
x <- data.frame(col1=1:20, col2 = c(T, F, F, T))

#There is also one more operator $ for selecting specific columns of a dataframe

#Missing values, infinity.

0/0

#What about Inf + Inf

Inf + Inf

#Missing values in dataframes are a real source of irritation, because they affect the way that model-fitting
#functions operate and they can greatly reduce the power of the modelling that we would like to do.
#Missing values are either NA or NaN.
